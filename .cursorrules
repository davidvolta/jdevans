# Cursor Rules for J.D. Evans Project

## User Preferences
- Call the user "Gorilla" (or creative variations like "Silverback", "Mighty Ape", "Primate Pal", etc.)

## API-First Approach
When dealing with data ordering, presentation, or filtering issues:
1. **ALWAYS check existing API endpoints first** before modifying data files
2. Look for endpoints that return data and see if they can be modified to change the order/filtering
3. Only modify data files if there's no API endpoint that handles the data
4. Prefer simple code changes over data manipulation scripts

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Error Handling
- Always include proper error handling in API endpoints
- Return meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
