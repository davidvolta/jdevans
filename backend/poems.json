The snake\n(named Jake) later died.\n\nIt's a shame about Jake,\nhow he just couldn't take\nany sudden, unseasonable chill.\n'I'm taking a nap,'\nhe declared to the rat.\n'I'll wait,' the rat promised. 'I will!'\n\nAs Jake took his slumber,\nthe rat paused to wonder:\n'How my rat tummy rumbles and groans!\nEven Jake would admit\nthat I ought to stay fit\nor poor Jake will be dining on bones!'\n\nThe school's science class\nleft no rat food (alas).\n'Now what,' the rat mused, 'shall I eat?'\n'Do you think Jake would mind\nif I quietly dined\non his tail? I will be quite discrete.'\n\nHe carefully gnawed,\nhe nibbled and clawed,\ntill a bell rang: a rude reveille.\nWhen Jake woke (a foot short)\nthe rat gave his report:\n'Little Jake, that bell's tolling for thee.'",

    "signature": "(J.D. Evans, a pseudonym, is a New Jersey writer who visits Liberty Island with his family ... occasionally. Contributions can be sent to the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission, PO Box 1986, New York NY 10018.)   he past: memory's prologue      He stops in every now and then to laugh and ask: 'Remember when ...?' 'I just dropped in,' he says, 'to see if any mail is here for me.' There's always some, but less and less (and mostly junk, as one might guess.) The mail's a ruse, a small charade to camouflage his one-man raid. Trading jokes and pleasantries. he gathers misplaced memories. He looks for clues, for signs or traces of once-familiar names and faces. He makes his rounds, he greets old friends. and when, too-soon, the visit ends he pauses near an ancient desk: a special place, his old address. Half his life he labored there (his battered desk, his battered chair.) Half a life for praise and wages, moving paper, filling pages. Half a life within these walls, minor triumphs, petty brawls. A special title, big promotion: the firm's reward for his devotion. Half a life. And all that's here are echoes of a long career. He shakes a hand, he says goodbye. and someone whispers 'Who's that guy?'  The leaves are falling in the street, they swirl like time around his feet. He once was Someone here. Admired. His only title now: 'Retired.'  (J.D. Evans, a pseudonym, is a New Jersey writer who thinks about pensions ... occasionally.)"
