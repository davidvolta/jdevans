    Hogging heat keeps kifly quite comfyThe cat’s on the heat vent. That means winter’s here. (He doesn’t go near itthe rest of the year.)He heads for the heat vent as temperatures fall,The furnace kicks on and he answers its call. He plops himself down just as smug as can be and hogs the hot airthat was meant to warm me! He’ll sit there all night.If I shout, he’ll just stare. My bedroom’s an icebox? The cat doesn’t care.The Cat of Gibraltar.He sits like a rockwhile my teeth ch-chatter and my knees kn-knock. All night he’ll stay warm and I’ll hear the beast purr as I shiver and wonder:‘How come HE has fur?!”(J.D.

And, in the end, it’s worth the time we sacrifice. (Thank Claus it comes but once a year. I’m not sure I could handle twice!)(J.D.
